*This is on hold until the [HTMLBars](https://github.com/tildeio/htmlbars) API settles down.*

## Contributing
The API/syntax will be in flux before the `v1.0.0` stable release. If you have comments or suggestions, definitely jump in. Particularly focused on high-performance use cases such as [dbmonster](https://dbmonster.firebaseapp.com/), high through-put realtime charts, and other render intensive components.
